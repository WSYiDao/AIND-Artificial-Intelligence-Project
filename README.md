# AIND-Artificial_Intelligence_and_Specializations-Project

- Project1: Creating an AI Agent to solve diagonal sudoku problem include more heuristics solution, and use `naked twins` technique.
- Project2: Develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation"
- Project3: Define problems in classical PDDL and planning graph heuristics to solve the problems.
- Project4: Build a system that can recognize Sign Language words communicated
- Project5: CNN and Transfer Learning. Create a model to Classify Dog Breeds by using CNN and Transfer Learning.
- Project6: Keras, LSTMs & RNNs. Create time series prediction and text generation.
- Project7: OpenCV & CNN. Build end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system
